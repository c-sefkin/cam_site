## Description
Learn how to create responsive single-page websites with PostCSS, the CSS post-processor engine that extends the power of CSS through JavaScript. These step-by-step instructions take existing HTML markup and add style, animation, and responsive navigation. This combination allows for dynamic one-page sitesâ€”a popular design that's now even faster and easier to create with PostCSS. Along the way, Ray Villalobos introduces some handy plugins, tips for integrating PostCSS into a Gulp-based workflow, and techniques for making layouts more responsive with Flexbox.

### Topics include

- Structuring the HTML markup for a single-page design
- Using PreCSS Sass-like imports in PostCSS
- Creating Sass-like variables with PreCSS
- Building styles
- Creating a layout for the header and navigation with Flexbox
- Creating and styling sections
- Animating page elements with PostCSS
